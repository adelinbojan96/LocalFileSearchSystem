# [Local File Search System](https://github.com/your-repository-url) Architecture

This is a guide to the internals of the Local File Search System.

The Local File Search System is a software application designed to help users quickly find and access files stored on their local device by indexing and searching through file metadata, content, and filenames. It serves general computer users, small businesses, media and content creators, and IT administrators.

## Scope of the Local File Search System and its Dependencies

The Local File Search System consists of multiple components that interact to provide a smooth search experience for users.

### **Web Application**

The web application is the user-facing component that interacts with the system, allowing users to search for files and view results.

- **User Interface (Web)**: The front-end application where users can input search queries and view the search results.
- **Search Query Handler**: Handles the search query submissions and interacts with the back-end to fetch search results.
- **Results Display**: Displays the search results, including file metadata and content previews like file names, locations, and excerpts from the file content.

### **Database**

The database stores file metadata, content, and indexing information for fast retrieval during searches.

- **Database Schema**: Defines the tables and structure for storing file metadata, content, and indexing information.
- **File Metadata Extractor**: Extracts metadata such as file name, type, size, and modification dates from files to store in the database.
- **File Storage Manager**: Manages file storage and access, ensuring files are stored and retrieved efficiently.

### **File System**

The file system component is responsible for managing the physical files on the userâ€™s device and interacting with the database.

- **File Retriever**: Retrieves files based on a search query, accessing file paths and metadata.
- **File Metadata Extractor**: Extracts file metadata (e.g., size, type) to be indexed and stored in the database.
- **File Storage Manager**: Manages file storage on the local device, ensuring proper organization and efficient access.

### **Content Updater**

The content updater keeps the index and metadata synchronized with the local file system, ensuring that the database reflects the latest changes in the file system.

- **File Monitor**: Watches for file system changes such as new files, modified files, and deleted files, updating the index accordingly.
- **Content Synchronizer**: Synchronizes the database with the file system, ensuring metadata and content are updated in real time.
- **File Update Handler**: Handles updates to files (e.g., new content, file modification) and ensures their changes are reflected in the database.

### **GitHub Connector**

The GitHub connector is used to retrieve files from private GitHub repositories, allowing them to be indexed and searched alongside local files.

## Classes

### `FileSystem`

The `FileSystem` class is responsible for interacting with the local file storage. It retrieves files based on search queries and manages file access.

- **File Retriever**: A component that retrieves the file paths based on query results.
- **File Metadata Extractor**: Extracts file metadata from files stored on the local device.
- **File Storage Manager**: Handles how files are stored and accessed on the file system.

### `Database`

The `Database` class manages the storage and retrieval of file metadata, content, and indexing information.

- **Database Schema**: Defines how the data is stored, including tables for files, metadata, and content.
- **File Metadata Extractor**: Extracts metadata from files to be stored in the database.
- **File Storage Manager**: Ensures efficient file storage and access in the database.

### `ContentUpdater`

The `ContentUpdater` ensures the system remains synchronized with the file system, updating file data and metadata as changes occur.

- **File Monitor**: Detects changes in the local file system and updates the database.
- **Content Synchronizer**: Keeps the index synchronized in real-time with file system changes.
- **File Update Handler**: Handles file updates when new content is added or modified.

### `GitHubConnector`

The `GitHubConnector` component retrieves files from private GitHub repositories and integrates them into the local file index.

## Public API

The public API provides methods for interacting with the Local File Search System:

- **search(query)**: Searches the indexed files based on the given query and returns the results.
- **getFileMetadata(fileId)**: Retrieves metadata for a specific file.
- **getFilePreview(fileId)**: Returns a preview (e.g., first few lines) of the file content.
- **updateFileIndex(filePath)**: Updates the index for a file if its content or metadata has changed.
- **syncFileSystem()**: Synchronizes the file system with the database to ensure the index is up to date.

## Classes and Methods Overview

- **`FileSystem`**: Interacts with the local file system to retrieve and store files.
- **`Database`**: Stores file metadata and content, and indexes files for fast search.
- **`ContentUpdater`**: Keeps the index updated in real-time as files are added, modified, or deleted.
- **`GitHubConnector`**: Integrates GitHub repositories into the search system, enabling the indexing of files from private code repositories.
